2D/3D WebGIS platform using React, OpenLayers and Cesium

## Workshop intro

As the most used front-end development library today, React.js is probably the best foundation when it comes to building WebGIS applications. The combination with a very robust and dynamic map library like OpenLayers makes it the perfect tool for the job. Transformation of spatial data from 2D to 3D view is achievable with Cesium.js. Throughout the duration of this workshop, participants will learn how to setup their own Web GISapplication using Vite, React.js, OpenLayers and Cesium libraries and the Tailwind framework.

Participants will learn how to:

-   Set up a basic React app,

-   Integrate OpenLayers with React,

-   Integrate Cesium.js with React and OpenLayers,

-   Add and control base maps displayed in 2D and 3D,

-   Load and display vector data and point clouds on the map,

-   Transition from 2D to 3D view and

-   Implement measurement tools in 2D and 3D.

Don't worry if you're not skilled with React or JavaScript, this workshop aims to cover all the basic steps to get you up and running. The workshop is divided into several chapters - /_LIST ALL CHAPTERS_/.

It is intended and recommended to use the Visual Studio Code editor, but we see no reason not to use another option if you are used to it. Let's start installing the necessary packages!

## Step 1

### Node.js and npm

To successfully execute our code, we will first install the open source Node.js cross-platform server environment and the npm package manager for the JavaScript programming language.

We can use a Node installer to install both Node.js and npm on our system.

-   Node.js installer -> <https://nodejs.org/en/download> (OS X or Windows users)

-   NodeSource installer -> <https://github.com/nodesource/distributions> (Linux users)

Be sure to install the version labeledÂ LTS. Other versions have not yet been tested with npm. If you need help with installation, the following links provide detailed instructions for each operating system:

Linux: <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-linux/>
